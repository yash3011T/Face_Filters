Face Filters Python Application
Overview
The Face Filters Python application is a fun and engaging Computer Vision project that enhances user experience by adding creative filters to facial features in real-time video streams. This project leverages facial key point detection, real-time filter application, and advanced image augmentation techniques to create a Snapchat-like experience for users.

Features
Facial Key Point Detection: The application utilizes Computer Vision algorithms to detect key facial points such as eyes, nose, and mouth. This allows precise placement of filters on the user's face.

Real-time Filter Application: Filters are applied to the video stream in real-time, ensuring a seamless and interactive experience for the user.

Creative Filters: The application includes a variety of creative filters that users can choose from. These filters can range from simple color overlays to more complex effects like facial distortion or augmented reality enhancements.

User-friendly Interface: The application is designed with a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily select and apply filters to their video feed.

High Performance: The project is optimized for performance, ensuring that filters are applied smoothly and without significant lag, even on standard hardware.
